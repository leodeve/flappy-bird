# flappy-bird

I have followed the 15 videos of Brent Aureli on YouTube that explain how to code Flappy Bird on Android Studio.
It also uses LibGDX, a cross-platform Game Development.
Here is the link to the first video of his series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzBVTPaUUDg&list=PLZm85UZQLd2TPXpUJfDEdWTSgszionbJypackage

Then, I added a score with a nice font thank to the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKqIx5XpxVw&list=PL07lH_mFGxLRn-W3XgsVrXOGp8IoRUf9c&index=13

I also added a highscore to make the game more interesting.
